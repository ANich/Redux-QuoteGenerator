## Redux-QuoteGenerator
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ANich/Redux-QuoteGenerator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ANich/Redux-QuoteGenerator)

This is mostly a playground for me to test technologies and techniques in the react/redux ecosystem. Feel free to clone and try it out yourself!

Based on the [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) Quote Generator Project.

### Usage:
* Installation: clone the `master` branch then run `npm install`
* Tests: `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch` (to rerun tests on save)
* Dev-Server: `npm run start`

### Supplemental Information:

* Uses [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for module bundling.
* Uses [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io), [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [chai](http://chaijs.com/) for testing.
* Uses [Airbnb Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) to test react components.
